# Virtual Memory Simulator - Enhancement Summary

## New Features Added

### 1. LFU (Least Frequently Used) Algorithm
- Tracks access frequency for each page
- Replaces page with lowest frequency count
- Tie-breaking uses FIFO for equal frequencies
- Effective for workloads with repeated access patterns

### 2. Export Functionality
- CSV export for tabular data analysis
- JSON export for programmatic processing
- TXT export for human-readable reports
- Comparison export for multi-algorithm results
- Accessible via "Export Results" button in GUI

### 3. Enhanced Test Suite
- Now tests 5 algorithms (FIFO, LRU, LFU, Optimal, Clock)
- Comprehensive performance metrics
- TLB statistics for each algorithm
- Working set analysis

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Professional documentation without unnecessary formatting
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper error handling and validation
- Type hints for better code clarity

### Architecture
- ResultsExporter class for unified export handling
- Extended algorithm base class
- Enhanced comparison widget with return values
- State management for export functionality

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation

- `gui/main_window.py` - Added export button and functionality
- `gui/comparison_widget.py` - Returns results for export
- `test_algorithms.py` - Updated to include LFU

### Utilities
- `utils/exporter.py` - New export functionality (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- `utils/__init__.py` - Updated exports

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Professional format, added LFU documentation

## Algorithm Performance

Based on test with reference string `[7,0,1,2,0,3,0,4,2,3,0,3,2,1,2,0,1,7,0,1]`:

| Algorithm | Page Faults | Hit Ratio | TLB Hit Ratio |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| FIFO      | 15          | 25.00%    | 25.00%        |
| LRU       | 15          | 25.00%    | 25.00%        |
| LFU       | 15          | 25.00%    | 25.00%        |
| Optimal   | 13          | 35.00%    | 35.00%        |
| Clock     | 15          | 25.00%    | 25.00%        |
